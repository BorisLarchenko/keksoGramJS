# keksoGramJS
This is a js project that shows my skills in java script
In order to test this project you should have node.js installed
Use the following commands to check this project:

git clone https://github.com/BorisLarchenko/keksoGramJS

cd keksoGramJS/

npm install

npm run start


That’s all. After that you’ll see the JS site that should start automatically on you default browser.
Use http://localhost:3000 in order to see this JS site if something went really wrong.
Do not forget to push the central button and downlad any document.
You should see the cat picture with lots of interesting effects.)
